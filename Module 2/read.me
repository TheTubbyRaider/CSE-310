# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the JavaScript language.}
As a software engineer aiming to deepen my knowledge of JavaScript, 
I developed a Task Management Application. This project demonstrates 
the core concepts of JavaScript, including DOM manipulation, event 
handling, and array methods. My goal with this project was to gain 
practical experience with these fundamental programming techniques
 and strengthen my ability to build interactive web applications. 
 This experience will help me continue growing my skills for more 
 advanced front-end development work in the future.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
The purpose of writing this software was to practice and showcase
 my understanding of JavaScript syntax and capabilities. I wanted 
 to focus on building a user-friendly application that performs basic
  task management functions like adding, completing, and deleting tasks.
  Through this, I learned how to use JavaScript to manipulate HTML elements 
  dynamically and create a fully interactive interface.



{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
Visual Studio Code: My primary code editor, which supports 
JavaScript development and makes it easy to test and debug the code.
Google Chrome: To test and debug the web application using Chrome DevTools.

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
JavaScript: The main programming language used for building the interactive features.
CSS: For styling the task management app to ensure it is visually clean and easy to use.
HTML: For structuring the web application and defining the layout of the task management interface.
